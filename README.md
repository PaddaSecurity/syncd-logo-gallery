# Logo Gallery

This project is sponsored by [Syncd](https://syncd.dev).
In our V2 library we use logos currated from [SVGLibrary](https://svgl.app). So thank you to them for making this possible!

Welcome to the Logo Gallery! This project provides a collection of static SVG and PNG logos for easy integration into your websites and applications.

## Features

- Pre-rendered SVG and PNG logo files
- Simple URL-based access
- Ready for direct embedding or linking

## Usage

To use a logo from the gallery, use the following URL format:

https://syncdpublic.dev/logos/logo.(svg|png)

## V2 Usage

The V2 folder (/logos-v2) contains a different naming convention and a different set of logos. These logos are also available in SVG format.

To use a logo from the V2 gallery, use the following URL format:

https://syncdpublic.dev/logos-v2/logo.svg or for dark and light themes:

https://syncdpublic.dev/logos-v2/logo.dark.svg
https://syncdpublic.dev/logos-v2/logo.light.svg

Note some logos are only available in one theme. In that case just access them like this:

https://syncdpublic.dev/logos-v2/logo.svg
